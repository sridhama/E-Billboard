Demo video: https://youtu.be/MsXc8tdRfdY

E-Billboard is a smart and dynamic information display system. It can recognize a bystander's face and show them relevant information like their lunch menu, daily schedule, pertinent news, and more. The face recognition is done with a Haar feature-based cascade classifier using OpenCV. Ideally, the whole system is meant to run on a Raspberry Pi that is equipped with a camera module and is connected to an external display. For distributed computing, the system can also run on a server connected to a camera and relay this data back to a Raspberry Pi.
